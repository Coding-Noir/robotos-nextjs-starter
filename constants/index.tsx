    question: "What Are Robotos?",
    answer:
      "Robotos is a collection of algorithmically generated droid characters designed by Pablo Stanley and minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation of 10,000 droids will be constructed from various metal outfits, tin faces, digital accessories, top pieces, faces, backpacks, arms, and colors. Robotos have different body types, some rarer than others, and... there are rumors that you could find humans pretending to be robots too. Is it true? 🤔",
